License Information
===================

For arcmage, we have chosen to split the license for the "game", the "software" and the license for the "artwork".

Game License
=============

The game license contains the following work and is under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

    - The arcmage rules (the text of the rules as published on the wiki)
    - The card rules (the text of all the cards as published in our card database)
    - The templates, faction logo’s, fonts and the card back (without logo) are part of Wtactics and is dual licensed under GPL3 and CC-BY-SA4.
    - That makes that each card front side in itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

The cards uses some external fonts and have the following licenses

    - Liberation Serif (uses SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 – 26 February 2007, https://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/liberation-serif)

The arcmage logo is under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

You rights and obligations

    - In short, for the game, you may play the game, duplicate it however you want, spread it and even sell it if you want to, but whatever you do you must always do it according to the license(s) we use.
        - Those are: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
        - A part of those licenses demand that a copy of the license is to be included with the game when you spread the game and/or its related material.
        - A very important point is also that the licenses are copyleft and self-propagating: However you use Arcmage and/or it’s material the end product would still be licensed under the same licenses as Arcmage itself.
        - The two paragraphs above are two important points from the licenses, but there are others. You must read the licenses in order to fully understand your rights and obligations.

    - In short, for the arcmage logo, you may spread it, and even sell it if you want to, but whatever you do you must always do it according to the license(s) we use.
        - Those are: Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.
        - An important point of this is that you may NOT make any derived versions of the logo.

    - When you distribute an unmodified card front in physical/paper form, we kindly request you also use the unmodified card back with the arcmage logo, and use our printing guidelines regarding quality, sizes and finishing methods.
	    - The reason for this limititation is that if you use our official front+back, that other players will expect the card rule's to be the official rules (as published on our website)
